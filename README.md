# LotteryContract
The Lottery Contract has the same priciples as a normal contract.

How it works:
An instance of the Lottery Contract can be created by someone. That person becomes the manager.
People can enter the lottery by specifying with some amount of ether.

Only the manager can invoke the function to choose a winner.
The winner gets all the ether that's in the lottery pot.

After the winner has been chosen, the contract will be reset and will be ready for the next lottery.
